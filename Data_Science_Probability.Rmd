The textbook for the Data Science course series is [freely available online](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/).

This course corresponds to the Probability section of textbook, starting [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html).

This course assumes you are comfortable with basic math, algebra, and logical operations. HarvardX has partnered with DataCamp for all assignments in R that allow you to program directly in a browser-based interface. You will not need to download any special software.

Using a combination of a guided introduction through short video lectures and more independent in-depth exploration, you will get to practice your new R skills on real-life applications.

Probability theory is the mathematical foundation of statistical inference which is indispensable for analyzing data affected by chance, and thus essential for data scientists. In this course, you will learn important concepts in probability theory. The motivation for this course is the circumstances surrounding the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Part of what caused this financial crisis was that the risk of certain securities sold by financial institutions was underestimated. To begin to understand this very complicated event, we need to understand the basics of probability. We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing are likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance. Statistical inference, covered in the next course in this series, builds upon probability theory.

## Learning Objectives

* Important concepts in probability theory including random variables and independence
* How to perform a Monte Carlo simulation
* The meaning of expected values and standard errors and how to compute them in R
* The importance of the Central Limit Theorem

## Course Overview

### Section 1: Discrete Probability
You will learn about basic principles of probability related to categorical data using card games as examples.

### Section 2: Continuous Probability
You will learn about basic principles of probability related to numeric and continuous data.

### Section 3: Random Variables, Sampling Models, and The Central Limit Theorem
You will learn about random variables (numeric outcomes resulting from random processes), how to model data generation procedures as draws from an urn, and the Central Limit Theorem, which applies to large sample sizes.

### Section 4: The Big Short
You will learn how interest rates are determined and how some bad assumptions led to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

## Section 1 Overview

Section 1 introduces you to Discrete Probability. Section 1 is divided into three parts:

* Introduction to Discrete Probability
* Combinations and Permutations
* Addition Rule and Monty Hall

After completing Section 1, you will be able to:

* Apply basic probability theory to categorical data.
* Perform a Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the results of repeating an experiment over and over, including simulating the outcomes in the Monty Hall problem.
* Distinguish between: sampling with and without replacement, events that are and are not independent, and combinations and permutations.
* Apply the multiplication and addition rules, as appropriate, to calculate the probably of multiple events occurring.
* Use **sapply** instead of a for loop to perform element-wise operations on a function.

## Discrete Probability

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#discrete-probability)

**Key points**

* The *probability of an event* is the proportion of times the event occurs when we repeat the experiment independently under the same conditions.

$Pr(A)$ = probability of event A

* An *event* is defined as an outcome that can occur when when something happens by chance.
* We can determine probabilities related to discrete variables (picking a red bead, choosing 48 Democrats and 52 Republicans from 100 likely voters) and continuous variables (height over 6 feet).

## Monte Carlo Simulations

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#monte-carlo-simulations)

**Key points**

* Monte Carlo simulations model the probability of different outcomes by repeating a random process a large enough number of times that the results are similar to what would be observed if the process were repeated forever.
* The **sample** function draws random outcomes from a set of options.
* The **replicate** function repeats lines of code a set number of times. It is used with **sample** and similar functions to run Monte Carlo simulations.

*Code: The rep function and the sample function*

```{r}
beads <- rep(c("red", "blue"), times = c(2,3))    # create an urn with 2 red, 3 blue
beads    # view beads object

sample(beads, 1)    # sample 1 bead at random
```

*Code: Monte Carlo simulation*

Note that your exact outcome values will differ because the sampling is random.

```{r}
B <- 10000    # number of times to draw 1 bead
events <- replicate(B, sample(beads, 1))    # draw 1 bead, B times
tab <- table(events)    # make a table of outcome counts
tab    # view count table
prop.table(tab)    # view table of outcome proportions
```

## Setting the Random Seed

The **set.seed** function

Before we continue, we will briefly explain the following important line of code:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1986)
```

Throughout this book, we use random number generators. This implies that many of the results presented can actually change by chance, which then suggests that a frozen version of the book may show a different result than what you obtain when you try to code as shown in the book. This is actually fine since the results are random and change from time to time. However, if you want to to ensure that results are exactly the same every time you run them, you can set R’s random number generation seed to a specific number. Above we set it to 1986. We want to avoid using the same seed every time. A popular way to pick the seed is the year - month - day. For example, we picked 1986 on December 20, 2018:  2018 − 12 − 20 = 1986.

You can learn more about setting the seed by looking at the documentation:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
```?set.seed
```

In the exercises, we may ask you to set the seed to assure that the results you obtain are exactly what we expect them to be.

**Important note on seeds in R 3.5 and R 3.6**

R was updated to version 3.6 in early 2019. In this update, the default method for setting the seed changed. This means that exercises, videos, textbook excerpts and other code you encounter online may yield a different result based on your version of R.

If you are running R 3.6, you can revert to the original seed setting behavior by adding the argument sample.kind="Rounding". For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(1)
set.seed(1, sample.kind="Rounding")    # will make R 3.6 generate a seed as in R 3.5
```

Using the ```sample.kind="Rounding"``` argument will generate a message:

```non-uniform 'Rounding' sampler used```

This is not a warning or a cause for alarm - it is a confirmation that R is using the alternate seed generation method, and you should expect to receive this message in your console.

**If you use R 3.6, you should always use the second form of set.seed in this course series (outside of DataCamp assignments).** Failure to do so may result in an otherwise correct answer being rejected by the grader. In most cases where a seed is required, you will be reminded of this fact.

## Using the mean Function for Probability

**An important application of the ```mean``` function**

In R, applying the ```mean``` function to a logical vector returns the proportion of elements that are TRUE. It is very common to use the ```mean``` function in this way to calculate probabilities and we will do so throughout the course.

Suppose you have the vector beads:

```{r}
beads <- rep(c("red", "blue"), times = c(2,3))
beads

# To find the probability of drawing a blue bead at random, you can run:
mean(beads == "blue")
```

This code is broken down into steps inside R. First, R evaluates the logical statement ```beads == "blue"```, which generates the vector:

```FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE```

When the ```mean``` function is applied, R coerces the logical values to numeric values, changing TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0:

```0 0 1 1 1```

The mean of the zeros and ones thus gives the proportion of TRUE values. As we have learned and will continue to see, probabilities are directly related to the proportion of events that satisfy a requirement.

## Probability Distributions

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#discrete-probability-distributions)

**Key points**

* The probability distribution for a variable describes the probability of observing each possible outcome.
* For discrete categorical variables, the probability distribution is defined by the proportions for each group.

## Independence

The textbook section on independence, conditional probability and the multiplication rule is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#independence)

**Key points**

* *Conditional probabilities* compute the probability that an event occurs given information about dependent events. For example, the probability of drawing a second king given that the first draw is a king is:

$Pr(Card\:2\:is\:a\:king \mid Card\:1\:is\:a\:king) = 3/51$

* If two events $A$ and $B$ are independent, $Pr(A \mid B) = Pr(A)$.
* To determine the probability of multiple events occurring, we use the *multiplication rule*.

**Equations**

The multiplication rule for independent events is:

$Pr(A\:and\:B\:and\:C) = Pr(A)\:X\:Pr(B)\:X\:Pr(C)$ 

The multiplication rule for dependent events considers the conditional probability of both events occurring:

$Pr(A\:and\:B) = Pr(A)\:X\:Pr(B \mid A)$

We can expand the multiplication rule for dependent events to more than 2 events:

$Pr(A\:and\:B\:and\:C) = Pr(A)\:X\:Pr(B \mid A)\:X\:Pr(C \mid A\:and\:B)$

## Assessment - Introduction to Discrete Probability (using R)

1. Probability of cyan

One ball will be drawn at random from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls. 

What is the probability that the ball will be cyan?

```{r}
cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

# Assign a variable `p` as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box
p <- cyan/(cyan+magenta+yellow)

# Print the variable `p` to the console
p
```

2. Probability of not cyan

One ball will be drawn at random from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls. 

What is the probability that the ball will not be cyan?

```{r}
# `p` is defined as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
# Using variable `p`, calculate the probability of choosing any ball that is not cyan from the box
p <- cyan/(cyan+magenta+yellow)
prop <- 1 - p
prop
```

3. Sampling without replacement

Instead of taking just one draw, consider taking two draws. You take the second draw without returning the first draw to the box. We call this sampling without replacement. 

What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?

```{r}
# The variable `p_1` is the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box on the first draw.
p_1 <- cyan / (cyan + magenta + yellow)

# Assign a variable `p_2` as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw without replacement.
p_2 <- (magenta+yellow)/((cyan-1)+magenta+yellow) 
p_2
# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan using `p_1` and `p_2`.
p_1 * p_2
```

4. Sampling with replacement

Now repeat the experiment, but this time, after taking the first draw and recording the color, return it back to the box and shake the box. We call this sampling with replacement. What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?

```{r}
# The variable 'p_1' is the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box on the first draw.
p_1 <- cyan / (cyan + magenta + yellow)

# Assign a variable 'p_2' as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw with replacement.
p_2 <- (magenta + yellow) / (cyan + magenta + yellow)

# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan using `p_1` and `p_2`.
p_1  * p_2
```

## Combinations and Permutations

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#combinations-and-permutations)

**Key points**

* **paste** joins two strings and inserts a space in between.
* **expand.grid** gives the combinations of 2 vectors or lists.
* **permutations(n,r)** from the **gtools** package lists the different ways that **r** items can be selected from a set of **n** options when order matters.
* **combinations(n,r)** from the **gtools** package lists the different ways that **r** items can be selected from a set of **n** options when order does not matter.

*Code: Introducing paste and expand.grid*

```{r}
# joining strings with paste
number <- "Three"
suit <- "Hearts"
paste(number, suit)

# joining vectors element-wise with paste
paste(letters[1:5], as.character(1:5))

# generating combinations of 2 vectors with expand.grid
expand.grid(pants = c("blue", "black"), shirt = c("white", "grey", "plaid"))
```

*Code: Generating a deck of cards*

```{r}
suits <- c("Diamonds", "Clubs", "Hearts", "Spades")
numbers <- c("Ace", "Deuce", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King")
deck <- expand.grid(number = numbers, suit = suits)
deck <- paste(deck$number, deck$suit)

# probability of drawing a king
kings <- paste("King", suits)
mean(deck %in% kings)
```

*Code: Permutations and combinations*

```{r}
if(!require(gtools)) install.packages("gtools")

library(gtools)
permutations(5,2)    # ways to choose 2 numbers in order from 1:5

all_phone_numbers <- permutations(10, 7, v = 0:9)
n <- nrow(all_phone_numbers)
index <- sample(n, 5)
all_phone_numbers[index,]

permutations(3,2)    # order matters
combinations(3,2)    # order does not matter
```

*Code: Probability of drawing a second king given that one king is drawn*

```{r}
hands <- permutations(52,2, v = deck)
first_card <- hands[,1]
second_card <- hands[,2]
sum(first_card %in% kings)

sum(first_card %in% kings & second_card %in% kings) / sum(first_card %in% kings)
```

*Code: Probability of a natural 21 in blackjack*

```{r}
aces <- paste("Ace", suits)

facecard <- c("King", "Queen", "Jack", "Ten")
facecard <- expand.grid(number = facecard, suit = suits)
facecard <- paste(facecard$number, facecard$suit)

hands <- combinations(52, 2, v=deck) # all possible hands

# probability of a natural 21 given that the ace is listed first in `combinations`
mean(hands[,1] %in% aces & hands[,2] %in% facecard)

# probability of a natural 21 checking for both ace first and ace second
mean((hands[,1] %in% aces & hands[,2] %in% facecard)|(hands[,2] %in% aces & hands[,1] %in% facecard))
```

*Code: Monte Carlo simulation of natural 21 in blackjack*

Note that your exact values will differ because the process is random and the seed is not set.

```{r}
# code for one hand of blackjack
hand <- sample(deck, 2)
hand

# code for B=10,000 hands of blackjack
B <- 10000
results <- replicate(B, {
  hand <- sample(deck, 2)
  (hand[1] %in% aces & hand[2] %in% facecard) | (hand[2] %in% aces & hand[1] %in% facecard)
})
mean(results)
```

## The Birthday Problem

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#birthday-problem)

**Key points**

* **duplicated** takes a vector and returns a vector of the same length with **TRUE** for any elements that have appeared previously in that vector.
* We can compute the probability of shared birthdays in a group of people by modeling birthdays as random draws from the numbers 1 through 365. We can then use this sampling model of birthdays to run a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of shared birthdays.

*Code: The birthday problem*

```{r}
# checking for duplicated bdays in one 50 person group
n <- 50
bdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)    # generate n random birthdays
any(duplicated(bdays))    # check if any birthdays are duplicated

# Monte Carlo simulation with B=10000 replicates
B <- 10000
results <- replicate(B, {    # returns vector of B logical values
    bdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
    any(duplicated(bdays))
})
mean(results)    # calculates proportion of groups with duplicated bdays
```

## sapply

The textbook discussion of the basics of **sapply** can be found [in this textbook section](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/programming-basics.html#vectorization).

The textbook discussion of **sapply** for the birthday problem can be found within [the birthday problem section](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#birthday-problem).

**Key points**

* Some functions automatically apply element-wise to vectors, such as **sqrt** and *****.
* However, other functions do not operate element-wise by default. This includes functions we define ourselves.
* The function **sapply(x, f)** allows any other function **f** to be applied element-wise to the vector **x**.
* The probability of an event happening is 1 minus the probability of that event not happening:

$Pr(event) = 1 - Pr(no\:event)

* We can compute the probability of shared birthdays mathematically:

$Pr(shared:\birthdays) = 1 − Pr(no\:shared\:birthdays) = 1 − (1:\X \frac{364}{365}\:X \frac{363}{365}\:X...X\: \frac{365−n+1+}{365})$ 

*Code: Function for calculating birthday problem Monte Carlo simulations for any value of n*

Note that the function body of **compute_prob** is the code that we wrote earlier. If we write this code as a function, we can use **sapply** to apply this function to several values of **n**.

```{r}
# function to calculate probability of shared bdays across n people
compute_prob <- function(n, B = 10000) {
    same_day <- replicate(B, {
        bdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
        any(duplicated(bdays))
    })
    mean(same_day)
}

n <- seq(1, 60)
```

*Code: Element-wise operation over vectors and sapply*

```{r}
x <- 1:10
sqrt(x)    # sqrt operates on each element of the vector

y <- 1:10
x*y    # * operates element-wise on both vectors

compute_prob(n)    # does not iterate over the vector n without sapply

x <- 1:10
sapply(x, sqrt)    # this is equivalent to sqrt(x)

prob <- sapply(n, compute_prob)    # element-wise application of compute_prob to n
plot(n, prob)
```

*Computing birthday problem probabilities with sapply*

```{r}
# function for computing exact probability of shared birthdays for any n
exact_prob <- function(n){
    prob_unique <- seq(365, 365-n+1)/365   # vector of fractions for mult. rule
    1 - prod(prob_unique)    # calculate prob of no shared birthdays and subtract from 1
}

# applying function element-wise to vector of n values
eprob <- sapply(n, exact_prob)

# plotting Monte Carlo results and exact probabilities on same graph
plot(n, prob)    # plot Monte Carlo results
lines(n, eprob, col = "red")    # add line for exact prob
```

## How many Monte Carlo Experiments are enough?

Here is a link to the [matching textbook section](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#infinity-in-practice).

**Key points**

* The larger the number of Monte Carlo replicates $B$, the more accurate the estimate.
* Determining the appropriate size for $B$ can require advanced statistics.
* One practical approach is to try many sizes for $B$ and look for sizes that provide stable estimates.

*Code: Estimating a practical value of B*

This code runs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of shared birthdays using several **B** values and plots the results. When **B** is large enough that the estimated probability stays stable, then we have selected a useful value of **B**. 

```{r}
B <- 10^seq(1, 5, len = 100)    # defines vector of many B values
compute_prob <- function(B, n = 22){    # function to run Monte Carlo simulation with each B
    same_day <- replicate(B, {
        bdays <- sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
        any(duplicated(bdays))
    })
    mean(same_day)
}
prob <- sapply(B, compute_prob)    # apply compute_prob to many values of B
plot(log10(B), prob, type = "l")    # plot a line graph of estimates
```

## Assessment 2: Combinations and Permutations

1.Independence

Imagine you draw two balls from a box containing colored balls. You either replace the first ball before you draw the second or you leave the first ball out of the box when you draw the second ball.

Under which situation are the two draws independent of one another?

Remember that two events A and B are independent if Pr(A and B)=Pr(A)P(B).

- [ ] A. You don’t replace the first ball before drawing the next.
- [X] B. You do replace the first ball before drawing the next.
- [ ] C. Neither situation describes independent events.
- [ ] D. Both situations describe independent events.

2. Sampling with replacement

Say you’ve drawn 5 balls from the a box that has 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls, with replacement, and all have been yellow.

What is the probability that the next one is yellow?
```
cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

# Assign the variable 'p_yellow' as the probability that a yellow ball is drawn from the box.
p_yellow <- yellow/(cyan+magenta+yellow)
# Using the variable 'p_yellow', calculate the probability of drawing a yellow ball on the sixth draw. Print this value to the console.
p_yellow
```
```
## [1] 0.4666667
```
3. Rolling a die

If you roll a 6-sided die once, what is the probability of not seeing a 6? If you roll a 6-sided die six times, what is the probability of not seeing a 6 on any roll?
```
# Assign the variable 'p_no6' as the probability of not seeing a 6 on a single roll.
p_no6 <- 5/6

# Calculate the probability of not seeing a 6 on six rolls using `p_no6`. Print your result to the console: do not assign it to a variable.
p_no6^6
```
```
## [1] 0.334898
```
4. Probability the Celtics win a game

Two teams, say the Celtics and the Cavs, are playing a seven game series. The Cavs are a better team and have a 60% chance of winning each game.

What is the probability that the Celtics win at least one game? Remember that the Celtics must win one of the first four games, or the series will be over!

- Calculate the probability that the Cavs will win the first four games of the series.
- Calculate the probability that the Celtics win at least one game in the first four games of the series.
```
# Assign the variable `p_cavs_win4` as the probability that the Cavs will win the first four games of the series.
p_cavs_win4 <- 0.6^4

# Using the variable `p_cavs_win4`, calculate the probability that the Celtics win at least one game in the first four games of the series.
(1-p_cavs_win4)
```
```
## [1] 0.8704
```
5. Monte Carlo simulation for Celtics winning a game

Create a Monte Carlo simulation to confirm your answer to the previous problem by estimating how frequently the Celtics win at least 1 of 4 games. Use B <- 10000 simulations.

The provided sample code simulates a single series of four random games, simulated_games
- Use the replicate function for B <- 10000 simulations of a four game series.
- Within each simulation, replicate the sample code to simulate a four-game series named simulated_games.
- Then, use the any function to indicate whether the four-game series contains at least one win for the Celtics.
- Use the mean function to find the proportion of simulations that contain at least one win for the Celtics out of four games.
```
# This line of example code simulates four independent random games where the Celtics either lose or win. Copy this example code to use within the `replicate` function.
simulated_games <- sample(c("lose","win"), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4))

# The variable 'B' specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run. Let's run the Monte Carlo simulation 10,000 times.
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# Create an object called `celtic_wins` that replicates two steps for B iterations: (1) generating a random four-game series `simulated_games` using the example code, then (2) determining whether the simulated series contains at least one win for the Celtics.
celtic_wins <- replicate(B, {
  simulated_games <- sample(c("lose","win"), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4))
  any(simulated_games=="win")
})

# Calculate the frequency out of B iterations that the Celtics won at least one game. Print your answer to the console.
mean(celtic_wins)
```
```
## [1] 0.8757
```
## 1.3 Addition rule

The addition rule tells us that:

Pr(A or B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A and B)

This rule is intuitive: think of a Venn diagram. If we simply add the probabilities, we count the intersection twice so we need to substract one instance.

## The Monty Hall Problem

In the 1970s, there was a game show called “Let’s Make a Deal” and Monty Hall was the host. At some point in the game, contestants were asked to pick one of three doors. Behind one door there was a prize. The other doors had a goat behind them to show the contestant they had lost. After the contestant picked a door, before revealing whether the chosen door contained a prize, Monty Hall would open one of the two remaining doors and show the contestant there was no prize behind that door. Then he would ask “Do you want to switch doors?” What would you do?

We can use probability to show that if you stick with the original door choice, your chances of winning a prize remain 1 in 3. However, if you switch to the other door, your chances of winning double to 2 in 3! This seems counterintuitive. Many people incorrectly think both chances are 1 in 2 since you are choosing between 2 options. You can watch a detailed mathematical explanation of why this is here or read one here. Below we use a Monte Carlo simulation to see which strategy is better. Note that this code is written longer than it should be for pedagogical purposes.

Let’s start with the stick strategy:
```
B <- 10000
stick <- replicate(B, {
  doors <- as.character(1:3)
  prize <- sample(c("car", "goat", "goat"))
  prize_door <- doors[prize == "car"]
  my_pick  <- sample(doors, 1)
  show <- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(my_pick, prize_door)],1)
  stick <- my_pick
  stick == prize_door
})
mean(stick)
```
```
## [1] 0.3388
```
As we write the code, we note that the lines starting with my_pick and show have no influence on the last logical operation since we stick to our original choice anyway. From this we should realize that the chance is 1 in 3, what we began with.

Now let’s repeat the exercise, but consider the switch strategy:
```
switch <- replicate(B, {
  doors <- as.character(1:3)
  prize <- sample(c("car", "goat", "goat"))
  prize_door <- doors[prize == "car"]
  my_pick  <- sample(doors, 1)
  show <- sample(doors[!doors %in% c(my_pick, prize_door)], 1)
  stick <- my_pick
  switch <- doors[!doors%in%c(my_pick, show)]
  switch == prize_door
})
mean(switch)
```
```
## [1] 0.6708
```
The Monte Carlo estimate confirms the 2/3 calculation. This helps us gain some insight by showing that we are removing a door, show, that is definitely not a winner from our choices. We also see that unless we get it right when we first pick, you win: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.

## Assessment 3: The Addition Rule and Monty Hall

1. The Cavs and the Warriors

Two teams, say the Cavs and the Warriors, are playing a seven game championship series. The first to win four games wins the series. The teams are equally good, so they each have a 50-50 chance of winning each game.

If the Cavs lose the first game, what is the probability that they win the series?
```
# Assign a variable 'n' as the number of remaining games.
n <-6

# Assign a variable `l` to a list of all possible outcomes in all remaining games. Use the `rep` function on `list(outcomes)` to create list of length `n`.
l <- list(0:1)

# Create a data frame named 'possibilities' that contains all combinations of possible outcomes for the remaining games.
possibilities <- expand.grid(rep(l, n))

# Create a vector named 'results' that indicates whether each row in the data frame 'possibilities' contains enough wins for the Cavs to win the series.
results <- rowSums(possibilities)>=4

# Calculate the proportion of 'results' in which the Cavs win the series. Print the outcome to the console.
mean(results)
```
```
## [1] 0.34375
```
3. The Cavs and the Warriors - Monte Carlo

Confirm the results of the previous question with a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of the Cavs winning the series after losing the first game.
```
# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run. Let's run the Monte Carlo simulation 10,000 times.
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# Create an object called `results` that replicates for `B` iterations a simulated series and determines whether that series contains at least four wins for the Cavs.
results <- replicate(B, {
   cavs_wins <- sample(c(0,1), 6, replace = TRUE)
   sum(cavs_wins)>=4
})

# Calculate the frequency out of `B` iterations that the Cavs won at least four games in the remainder of the series. Print your answer to the console.
mean(results)
```
```
## [1] 0.3371
```
3. A and B play a series - part 1

Two teams, A and B, are playing a seven series game series. Team A is better than team B and has a p > 0.5 chance of winning each game.
```
# Let's assign the variable 'p' as the vector of probabilities that team A will win.
p <- seq(0.5, 0.95, 0.025)

# Given a value 'p', the probability of winning the series for the underdog team B can be computed with the following function based on a Monte Carlo simulation:
prob_win <- function(p){
  B <- 10000
  result <- replicate(B, {
    b_win <- sample(c(1,0), 7, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
    sum(b_win)>=4
    })
  mean(result)
}

# Apply the 'prob_win' function across the vector of probabilities that team A will win to determine the probability that team B will win. Call this object 'Pr'.
Pr <- sapply(p, prob_win)

# Plot the probability 'p' on the x-axis and 'Pr' on the y-axis.
plot(p, Pr)
```

4. A and B play a series - part 2

Repeat the previous exercise, but now keep the probability that team A wins fixed at p <- 0.75 and compute the probability for different series lengths. For example, wins in best of 1 game, 3 games, 5 games, and so on through a series that lasts 25 games.
```
# Given a value 'p', the probability of winning the series for the underdog team B can be computed with the following function based on a Monte Carlo simulation:
prob_win <- function(N, p=0.75){
      B <- 10000
      result <- replicate(B, {
        b_win <- sample(c(1,0), N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
        sum(b_win)>=(N+1)/2
        })
      mean(result)
    }

# Assign the variable 'N' as the vector of series lengths. Use only odd numbers ranging from 1 to 25 games.
N <- seq(1, 25, 2)

# Apply the 'prob_win' function across the vector of series lengths to determine the probability that team B will win. Call this object `Pr`.
Pr<- sapply(N, prob_win)

# Plot the number of games in the series 'N' on the x-axis and 'Pr' on the y-axis.
plot(N, Pr)
```

## Section 2 Overview

Section 2 introduces you to Continuous Probability.

After completing Section 2, you will:
- understand the differences between calculating probabilities for discrete and continuous data.
- be able to use cumulative distribution functions to assign probabilities to intervals when dealing with continuous data.
- be able to use R to generate normally distributed outcomes for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
- know some of the useful theoretical continuous distributions in addition to the normal distribution, such as the student-t, chi-squared, exponential, gamma, beta, and beta-binomial distributions.

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/probability.html#continuous-probability)

## Continuous Probability
```
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
```
```
data(heights)
x <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% pull(height)

#We defined the empirical distribution function as:
F <- function(a) mean(x<=a)
```
Keep in mind that we have not yet introduced probability in the context of CDFs. Let’s do this by asking the following: if I pick one of the male students at random, what is the chance that he is taller than 70.5 inches? Because every student has the same chance of being picked, the answer to this is equivalent to the proportion of students that are taller than 70.5 inches. Using the CDF we obtain an answer by typing:
```
1 - F(70)
```
```
## [1] 0.3768473
```
Once a CDF is defined, we can use this to compute the probability of any subset. For instance, the probability of a student being between height a and height b is:

F(b)-F(a)

## Theoretical Distribution

Obtained with the function pnorm. Using the normal distribution:
```
plot(prop.table(table(x)), xlab= "a= Height in inches", ylab= "Pr(x = a")
```

![Unknown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17474099/77337093-ba4dc600-6d28-11ea-8ec2-71ed62d9bca6.png)

The cumulative distribution for the normal distribution is defined by a mathematical formula, which in R can be obtained with the function pnorm. Using the normal distribution:
```
1 - pnorm(70.5, mean(x), sd(x))
```
```
## [1] 0.371369
```
```
#the normal distribution is useful for approximating the proportion of students reporting values in intervals like the following three:

#This is actual:
mean(x <= 68.5) - mean(x <= 67.5)
```
```
## [1] 0.114532
```
```
mean(x <= 69.5) - mean(x <= 68.5)
```
```
## [1] 0.1194581
```
```
mean(x <= 70.5) - mean(x <= 69.5)
```
```
## [1] 0.1219212
```
Note how close we get with the normal approximation:
```
#and this is the approximation:
pnorm(68.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(67.5, mean(x), sd(x)) 
```
```
## [1] 0.1031077
```
```
pnorm(69.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(68.5, mean(x), sd(x)) 
```
```
## [1] 0.1097121
```
```
pnorm(70.5, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(69.5, mean(x), sd(x)) 
```
```
## [1] 0.1081743
```
However, the approximation is not as useful for other intervals. For instance, notice how the approximation breaks down when we try to estimate:
```
mean(x <= 70.9) - mean(x<=70.1)
```
```
## [1] 0.02216749
```
```
#with
pnorm(70.9, mean(x), sd(x)) - pnorm(70.1, mean(x), sd(x))
```
```
## [1] 0.08359562
```
In general, we call this situation discretization. Although the true height distribution is continuous, the reported heights tend to be more common at discrete values, in this case, due to rounding. As long as we are aware of how to deal with this reality, the normal approximation can still be a very useful tool.

## Probability Density

The probability density at x is defined as the function, we’re going to call it little f of x, such that the probability distribution big F of a, which is the probability of x being less than or equal to a, is the integral of all values up to a of little f of x dx.

dnorm() is the probability density function for the normal distribution:
```
# the probability that a person is higher than 76 inch
avg <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
1 - pnorm(76, avg, s)
```
```
## [1] 0.03206008
```
```
dnorm(76, mean(x), sd(x))
```
```
## [1] 0.01990735
```
## Monte Carlo simulations for continuous variables

R provides functions to generate normally distributed outcomes. Specifically, the rnorm function takes three arguments: size, average (defaults to 0), and standard deviation (defaults to 1) and produces random numbers. Here is an example of how we could generate data that looks like our reported heights:
```
x <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% .$height
n <- length(x)
m <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
simulated_heights <- rnorm(n, m, s)

ds_theme_set()
data.frame(simulated_heights) %>% ggplot(aes(simulated_heights)) + geom_histogram(color='black', fill='#595959', binwidth=2)
```
![Unknown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17474099/77337596-62638f00-6d29-11ea-9af4-0e6976cb6874.png)

This is one of the most useful functions in R as it will permit us to generate data that mimics natural events and answers questions related to what could happen by chance by running Monte Carlo simulations.

If, for example, we pick 800 males at random, what is the distribution of the tallest person? How rare is a seven footer in a group of 800 males? The following Monte Carlo simulation helps us answer that question:
```
B <- 10000
tallest <- replicate(B, {
  simulated_data <- rnorm(800, m, s)
  max(simulated_data)
})

#Having a seven footer is quite rare:

mean(tallest >= 7*12)
```
```
## [1] 0.0214
```
```
#Here is the resulting distribution, note that it does not look normal.
ds_theme_set()
data.frame(tallest) %>% ggplot(aes(tallest)) + geom_histogram(color='black', fill='#595959', binwidth=1)
```

## Other Continuous Distributions

Other continuous distributions that we may encounter are the student-t, chi-squared, exponential, gamma, beta, and beta-binomial. R provides functions to compute the density, the quantiles, the cumulative distribution functions and to generate Monte Carlo simulations. R uses a convention that lets us remember the names, namely using the letters d, q, p and r in front of a shorthand for the distribution. We have already seen the functions dnorm, pnorm and rnorm for the normal distribution. The functions qnorm gives us the quantiles. We can therefore draw a distribution like this:
```
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 100)
data.frame(x, f = dnorm(x)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, f)) + 
  geom_line()
```

For example, for the student-t, described later in Section 17.10, the shorthand t is used so the functions are dt for the density, qt for the quantiles, pt for the cumulative distribution function, and rt for Monte Carlo simulation.

## Assessment 4: Continuous Probability

1. Distribution of female heights - 1

Assume the distribution of female heights is approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If we pick a female at random, what is the probability that she is 5 feet or shorter?

female_sd <- 3

# Using variables 'female_avg' and 'female_sd', calculate the probability that a randomly selected female is between the desired height range. Print this value to the console.
pnorm(67, female_avg,female_sd) - pnorm(61, female_avg,female_sd)
```
```
## [1] 0.6826895
```
- Distribution of female heights - 4

Repeat the previous exercise, but convert everything to centimeters. That is, multiply every height, including the standard deviation, by 2.54. What is the answer now?
- Convert the average height and standard deviation to centimeters by multiplying each value by 2.54.
- Repeat the previous calculation using pnorm to define the probability that a randomly chosen woman will have a height between 61 and 67 inches, converted to centimeters by multiplying each value by 2.54.
```
# Assign a variable 'female_avg' as the average female height. Convert this value to centimeters.
female_avg <- 64*2.54

# Assign a variable 'female_sd' as the standard deviation for female heights. Convert this value to centimeters.
female_sd <- 3*2.54

# Using variables 'female_avg' and 'female_sd', calculate the probability that a randomly selected female is between the desired height range. Print this value to the console.
pnorm(67*2.54, female_avg,female_sd) - pnorm(61*2.54, female_avg,female_sd)
```
```
## [1] 0.6826895
```
5. Probability of 1 SD from average

Compute the probability that the height of a randomly chosen female is within 1 SD from the average height.
- Calculate the values for heights one standard deviation taller and shorter than the average.
- Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen woman will be within 1 SD from the average height.
```
# Assign a variable 'female_avg' as the average female height.
female_avg <- 64

# Assign a variable 'female_sd' as the standard deviation for female heights.
female_sd <- 3

# To a variable named 'taller', assign the value of a height that is one SD taller than average.
taller <- female_avg + female_sd

# To a variable named 'shorter', assign the value of a height that is one SD shorter than average.
shorter <- female_avg - female_sd

# Calculate the probability that a randomly selected female is between the desired height range. Print this value to the console.
pnorm(taller, female_avg,female_sd) - pnorm(shorter, female_avg,female_sd)
```
```
## [1] 0.6826895
```

male_avg <- 69

# Assign a variable 'male_sd' as the standard deviation for male heights.
male_sd <- 3

# Determine the height of a man in the 99th percentile of the distribution.
qnorm(0.99, male_avg, male_sd)
```
```
## [1] 75.97904
```
7. Distribution of IQ scores

The distribution of IQ scores is approximately normally distributed. The expected value is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. Suppose you want to know the distribution of the person with the highest IQ in your school district, where 10,000 people are born each year.

Generate 10,000 IQ scores 1,000 times using a Monte Carlo simulation. Make a histogram of the highest IQ scores.
- Use the function rnorm to generate a random distribution of 10,000 values with a given average and standard deviation.
- Use the function max to return the largest value from a supplied vector.
- Repeat the previous steps a total of 1,000 times. Store the vector of the top 1,000 IQ scores as highestIQ.
- Plot the histogram of values using the function hist.
```
# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run.
B <- 1000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random number generation.
set.seed(1)

# Create an object called `highestIQ` that contains the highest IQ score from each random distribution of 10,000 people.
highestIQ <- replicate(B, {
    r <- rnorm(10000,100,15)
    max(r)
})

# Make a histogram of the highest IQ scores.
hist(highestIQ)
```

## Section 3 Overview

Section 3 introduces you to Random Variables, Sampling Models, and the Central Limit Theorem.

Section 3 is divided into two parts:
- Random Variables and Sampling Models
- The Central Limit Theorem.

After completing Section 3, you will:
- understand what random variables are, how to generate them, and the correct mathematical notation to use with them.
- be able to use sampling models to estimate characteristics of a larger population.
- be able to explain the difference between a distribution and a probability distribution.
- understand the Central Limit Theorem and the law of large numbers.

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/random-variables.html)

## Random variables

Random variables are numeric outcomes resulting from random processes. We can easily generate random variables using some of the simple examples we have shown. For example, define X to be 1 if a bead is blue and red otherwise:
```
beads <- rep( c("red", "blue"), times = c(2,3))
X <- ifelse(sample(beads, 1) == "blue", 1, 0)

#Here X is a random variable: every time we select a new bead the outcome changes randomly. See below:

ifelse(sample(beads, 1) == "blue", 1, 0)
```
```
## [1] 1
```
```
ifelse(sample(beads, 1) == "blue", 1, 0)
```
```
## [1] 1
```
```
ifelse(sample(beads, 1) == "blue", 1, 0)
```
```
## [1] 1
```
```
#Sometimes it's 1 and sometimes it's 0.
```
## Sampling Models

For example, we can model the process of polling likely voters as drawing 0’s- Republicans- and 1’s- Democrats- from an urn containing the 0 and 1 code for all likely voters.

In epidemiological studies, we often assume that the subjects in our study are a random sample from the population of interest. The data related to a specific outcome can be modeled as a random sample

Similarly, in experimental research, we often assume that the individual organisms we are studying- for example, worms, flies, or mice- are a random sample from a larger population.

Casino games offer a plethora of examples of real-world situations in which sampling models are used to answer specific questions.

Roulette wheel example
```
color <- rep(c("Black", "Red", "Green"), c(18,18,2))

n <- 1000
X <- sample(ifelse(color =="Red", -1, 1), n, replace = TRUE)

X <- sample(c(-1,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob=c(9/19, 10/19))
S <- sum(X)
S
```
```
## [1] 38
```
Running a Monte Carlo Simulation with the above example:
```
a <- 0
n <- 1000
B <- 10000
roulette_winnings <- function(n){
  X <- sample(c(-1,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob=c(9/19, 10/19))
  sum(X)
}
S <- replicate(B, roulette_winnings(n))

#Now we can ask the following: in our simulations, how often did we get sums less than or equal to a?

mean(S <= a)
```
```
## [1] 0.0492
```
```
#Now we can easily answer the casino's question: how likely is it that we will lose money?
mean(S<0)
```
```
## [1] 0.0438
```
```
s <- seq(min(S), max(S), length = 100)
normal_density <- data.frame(S = s, f=dnorm(s, mean(S), sd(S)))
data.frame(S=S) %>% ggplot(aes(S, ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", binwidth = 10) +
  ylab("Probability") +
  geom_line(data = normal_density, mapping=aes(s,f), color="blue")
```

In the histogram above, we see that the distribution appears to be approximately normal. A qq-plot will confirm that the normal approximation is close to perfect. If, in fact, the distribution is normal, then all we need to define the distribution is the average and the standard deviation. Because we have the original values from which the distribution is created, we can easily compute these:
```
mean(S)
```
```
## [1] 52.842
```
```
sd(S)
```
```
## [1] 31.50489
```
## Distributions versus Probability Distributions

Previously we described how any list of numbers, let’s call it x1 through xn,has a distribution. The definition is quite straightforward. We define capital F of a as a function that answers the question, what proportion of the list is less than or equal to a. Because they are useful summaries, when the distribution is approximately normal, we define the average and the standard deviation. These are defined with a straightforward operation of the list. In r we simply compute the average and standard deviation this way,
```
m <- sum(x)/length(x)
s <- sqrt(sum((x - m)^2) / length(x))
```
A random variable x has a distribution function. To define this, we do not need a list of numbers. It’s a theoretical concept. In this case, to define the distribution, we define capital F of a as a function that answers the question, what is the probability that x is less than or equal to a. There is no list of numbers. However, if x is defined by drawing from an urn with numbers in it, then there is a list, the list of numbers inside the urn. In this case, the distribution of that list is the probability distribution of x and the average and standard deviation of that list are the expected value and standard errors of the random variable. Another way to think about it that does not involve an urn is to run a Monte Carlo simulation and generate a very large list of outcomes of x. These outcomes are a list of numbers. The distribution of this list will be a very good approximation of the probability distribution of x. The longer the list, the better the approximation. The average and standard deviation of this list will approximate the expected value and standard error of the random variable.

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The Central Limit Theorem-or the CLT for short tells us that when the number of independent draws-also called sample size-is large, the probability distribution of the sum of these draws is approximately normal.

## Assessment 5: Random Variables and Sampling Models

1.American Roulette probabilities

An American roulette wheel has 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green pockets. Each red and black pocket is associated with a number from 1 to 36. The two remaining green slots feature “0” and “00”. Players place bets on which pocket they think a ball will land in after the wheel is spun. Players can bet on a specific number (0, 00, 1-36) or color (red, black, or green).

What are the chances that the ball lands in a green pocket?
```
# The variables `green`, `black`, and `red` contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green/(green+black+red)

# Print the variable `p_green` to the console
p_green
```
```
## [1] 0.05263158
```
2. American Roulette payout

In American roulette, the payout for winning on green is $17. This means that if you bet $1 and it lands on green, you get $17 as a prize.

Create a model to predict your winnings from betting on green one time.
- Use the sample function return a random value from a specified range of values.
- Use the prob = argument in the sample function to specify a vector of probabilities for returning each of the values contained in the vector of values being sampled.
- Take a single sample (n = 1).
```
# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Create a model to predict the random variable `X`, your winnings from betting on green. Sample one time.
x <- sample(c(17,-1), 1, replace = TRUE, prob=c(p_green, p_not_green))

# Print the value of `X` to the console
x
```
```
## [1] -1
```
3. American Roulette expected value

In American roulette, the payout for winning on green is $17. This means that if you bet $1 and it lands on green, you get $17 as a prize.In the previous exercise, you created a model to predict your winnings from betting on green.

Now, compute the expected value of X, the random variable you generated previously.
- Using the chances of winning $17 (p_green) and the chances of losing $1 (p_not_green), calculate the expected outcome of a bet that the ball will land in a green pocket.
```
# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket

4. American Roulette standard error

The standard error of a random variable X tells us the difference between a random variable and its expected value. You calculated a random variable X in exercise 2 and the expected value of that random variable in exercise 3.

Now, compute the standard error of that random variable, which represents a single outcome after one spin of the roulette wheel.
- Compute the standard error of the random variable you generated in exercise 2, or the outcome of any one spin of the roulette wheel.
- Recall that the payout for winning on green is $17 for a $1 bet.
```
# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Compute the standard error of the random variable
abs((17 - -1))*sqrt(p_green*p_not_green)
```
```
## [1] 4.019344
```
5. American Roulette sum of winnings

You modeled the outcome of a single spin of the roulette wheel, X, in exercise 2.

Now create a random variable S that sums your winnings after betting on green 1,000 times.
- Use set.seed to make sure the result of your random operation matches the expected answer for this problem.
- Specify the number of times you want to sample from the possible outcomes.
- Use the sample function to return a random value from a vector of possible values.
- Be sure to assign a probability to each outcome and to indicate that you are sampling with replacement.
```
# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 1000

# Create a vector called 'X' that contains the outcomes of 1000 samples
X <- sample(c(17,-1), size = n, replace=TRUE, prob=c(p_green, p_not_green))

# Assign the sum of all 1000 outcomes to the variable 'S'
S <- sum(X)

# Print the value of 'S' to the console
S
```
```
## [1] -10
```
6. American Roulette winnings expected value

In the previous exercise, you generated a vector of random outcomes, S, after betting on green 1,000 times.

What is the expected value of S?
- Using the chances of winning $17 (p_green) and the chances of losing $1 (p_not_green), calculate the expected outcome of a bet that the ball will land in a green pocket over 1,000 bets.
```
# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 1000

# Calculate the expected outcome of 1,000 spins if you win $17 when the ball lands on green and you lose $1 when the ball doesn't land on green
n * (p_green * 17 + p_not_green * (-1))
```
```
## [1] -52.63158
```
7. American Roulette winnings expected value

You generated the expected value of S, the outcomes of 1,000 bets that the ball lands in the green pocket, in the previous exercise.

What is the standard error of S?
- Compute the standard error of the random variable you generated in exercise 5, or the outcomes of 1,000 spins of the roulette wheel.
```
# The variables 'green', 'black', and 'red' contain the number of pockets for each color
green <- 2
black <- 18
red <- 18

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- green / (green+black+red)

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 1000

# Compute the standard error of the sum of 1,000 outcomes
sqrt(n) * abs((17 + 1))*sqrt(p_green*p_not_green)
```
```

## The Central Limit Theorem Continued

### Property 1: 

The first, is that the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of the expected values of the individual random variables.

### Property 2: 

The second, is that the expected value of random variables times a non-random constant is the expected value times that non-random constant.

### Property 3: 

The third, is that the square of the standard error of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of the square of the standard error of each random variable.

### Property 4: 

The fourth, is that the standard error of random variables times a non-random constant is the standard error times a non-random constant.

## Law of Large Numbers

An important implication of the final result is that the standard error of the average becomes smaller and smaller as n grows larger. When n is very large, then the standard error is practically 0 and the average of the draws converges to the average of the urn. This is known in statistical textbooks as the law of large numbers or the law of averages.

## How Large is Large in CLT?

In the lottery, the chance of winning are less than 1 in a million. Thousands of people play, so the number of draws is very large. So the central limit should work. Yet, the number of winners, the sum of the draws, range between 0, and in very extreme cases, four. This sum is certainly not well approximated by the normal distribution. So the central limit theorem doesn’t apply, even with a very large sample size. This is generally true when the probability of success is very low. In these cases, the Poisson distribution is more appropriate.

## Assessment 6: The Central Limit Theorem

1. American Roulette probability of winning money

The exercises in the previous chapter explored winnings in American roulette. In this chapter of exercises, we will continue with the roulette example and add in the Central Limit Theorem.

In the previous chapter of exercises, you created a random variable S that is the sum of your winnings after betting on green a number of times in American Roulette.

What is the probability that you end up winning money if you bet on green 100 times?
- Execute the sample code to determine the expected value avg and standard error se as you have done in previous exercises.
- Use the pnorm function to determine the probability of winning money.
```
# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- 2 / 38

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 100

# Calculate 'avg', the expected outcome of 100 spins if you win $17 when the ball lands on green and you lose $1 when the ball doesn't land on green
avg <- n * (17*p_green + -1*p_not_green)

# Compute 'se', the standard error of the sum of 100 outcomes
se <- sqrt(n) * (17 - -1)*sqrt(p_green*p_not_green)

# Using the expected value 'avg' and standard error 'se', compute the probability that you win money betting on green 100 times.
1-pnorm(0,avg,se)
```
```
## [1] 0.4479091
```
2. American Roulette Monte Carlo simulation

Create a Monte Carlo simulation that generates 10,000 outcomes of S, the sum of 100 bets.

Compute the average and standard deviation of the resulting list and compare them to the expected value (-5.263158) and standard error (40.19344) for S that you calculated previously.
- Use the replicate function to replicate the sample code for B <- 10000 simulations.
- Within replicate, use the sample function to simulate n <- 100 outcomes of either a win (17)oraloss(-1) for the bet. Use the order c(17, -1) and corresponding probabilities. Then, use the sum function to add up the winnings over all iterations of the model. Make sure to include sum or DataCamp may crash with a “Session Expired” error.
- Use the mean function to compute the average winnings.
- Use the sd function to compute the standard deviation of the winnings.
```
# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- 2 / 38

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1-p_green

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run. Let's run the Monte Carlo simulation 10,000 times.
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# Create an object called `S` that replicates the sample code for `B` iterations and sums the outcomes.
S <- replicate(B,{
   X <- sample(c(17,-1), size = n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(p_green, p_not_green))
   sum(X)
   })

# Compute the average value for 'S'
mean(S)

3. American Roulette Monte Carlo vs CLT

In this chapter, you calculated the probability of winning money in American roulette using the CLT.

Now, calculate the probability of winning money from the Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation from the previous exercise has already been pre-run for you, resulting in the variable S that contains a list of 10,000 simulated outcomes.
- Use the mean function to calculate the probability of winning money from the Monte Carlo simulation, S.
```
# Calculate the proportion of outcomes in the vector `S` that exceed $0
mean(S>0)
```
```
## [1] 0.4232
```
4. American Roulette Monte Carlo vs CLT comparison

The Monte Carlo result and the CLT approximation for the probability of losing money after 100 bets are close, but not that close. What could account for this?

- [ ] A. 10,000 simulations is not enough. If we do more, the estimates will match.
- [X] B. The CLT does not work as well when the probability of success is small.
- [ ] C. The difference is within rounding error.
- [ ] D. The CLT only works for the averages.

5. American Roulette average winnings per bet

Now create a random variable Y that contains your average winnings per bet after betting on green 10,000 times.
- Run a single Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 bets using the following steps. (You do not need to replicate the sample code.)
- Specify n as the number of times you want to sample from the possible outcomes.
- Use the sample function to return n values from a vector of possible values: winning $17 or losing $1. Be sure to assign a probability to each outcome and indicate that you are sampling with replacement.
- Calculate the average result per bet placed using the mean function.
```
# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 10000

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- 2 / 38

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1 - p_green

# Create a vector called `X` that contains the outcomes of `n` bets
X <- sample(c(17,-1), size = n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(p_green, p_not_green))

# Define a variable `Y` that contains the mean outcome per bet. Print this mean to the console.
Y <- mean(X)
Y
```
```
## [1] 0.008
```
6. American Roulette per bet expected value

What is the expected value of Y, the average outcome per bet after betting on green 10,000 times?
- Using the chances of winning $17 (p_green) and the chances of losing $1 (p_not_green), calculate the expected outcome of a bet that the ball will land in a green pocket.
- Print this value to the console (do not assign it to a variable).
```
# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- 2 / 38

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1 - p_green

# Calculate the expected outcome of `Y`, the mean outcome per bet in 10,000 bets
Y <- p_green * 17 + p_not_green * (-1)
Y
```
```
## [1] -0.05263158
```
7. American Roulette per bet standard error

What is the standard error of Y, the average result of 10,000 spins?
- Compute the standard error of Y, the average result of 10,000 independent spins.
```
# Define the number of bets using the variable 'n'
n <- 10000

# Assign a variable `p_green` as the probability of the ball landing in a green pocket
p_green <- 2 / 38

# Assign a variable `p_not_green` as the probability of the ball not landing in a green pocket
p_not_green <- 1 - p_green

# Compute the standard error of 'Y', the mean outcome per bet from 10,000 bets.
abs((17 - (-1))*sqrt(p_green*p_not_green) / sqrt(n))
```
```
## [1] 0.04019344
```
8. American Roulette winnings per game are positive

What is the probability that your winnings are positive after betting on green 10,000 times?
- Execute the code that we wrote in previous exercises to determine the average and standard error.
- Use the pnorm function to determine the probability of winning more than $0.
```
# We defined the average using the following code
avg <- 17*p_green + -1*p_not_green

# We defined standard error using this equation
se <- 1/sqrt(n) * (17 - -1)*sqrt(p_green*p_not_green)

# Given this average and standard error, determine the probability of winning more than $0. Print the result to the console.
1 - pnorm(0, avg, se)
```
```
## [1] 0.0951898
```
9. American Roulette Monte Carlo again

Create a Monte Carlo simulation that generates 10,000 outcomes of S, the average outcome from 10,000 bets on green.

Compute the average and standard deviation of the resulting list to confirm the results from previous exercises using the Central Limit Theorem.
- Use the replicate function to model 10,000 iterations of a series of 10,000 bets.
- Each iteration inside replicate should simulate 10,000 bets and determine the average outcome of those 10,000 bets. If you forget to take the mean, DataCamp will crash with a “Session Expired” error.
- Find the average of the 10,000 average outcomes.
- Compute the standard deviation of the 10,000 simulations.
```
# The variable `n` specifies the number of independent bets on green
n <- 10000

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random number generation
set.seed(1)

# Generate a vector `S` that contains the the average outcomes of 10,000 bets modeled 10,000 times
S <- replicate(B,{  
  X <- sample(c(17,-1), size = n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(p_green, p_not_green))
  mean(X)
})

# Compute the average of `S`

```
```
# Compute the standard deviation of `S`
sd(S)
```
```
## [1] 0.03996168
```
10. American Roulette comparison

In a previous exercise, you found the probability of winning more than $0 after betting on green 10,000 times using the Central Limit Theorem. Then, you used a Monte Carlo simulation to model the average result of betting on green 10,000 times over 10,000 simulated series of bets.

What is the probability of winning more than $0 as estimated by your Monte Carlo simulation? The code to generate the vector S that contains the the average outcomes of 10,000 bets modeled 10,000 times has already been run for you.
- Calculate the probability of winning more than $0 in the Monte Carlo simulation from the previous exercise.
- You do not need to run another simulation: the results of the simulation are in your workspace as the vector S.
```
# Compute the proportion of outcomes in the vector 'S' where you won more than $0
mean(S>0)
```
```
## [1] 0.0977
```
11. American Roulette comparison analysis

The Monte Carlo result and the CLT approximation are now much closer than when we calculated the probability of winning for 100 bets on green. What could account for this difference?

- [ ] A. We are now computing averages instead of sums.
- [ ] B. 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations was not enough to provide a good estimate.
- [X] C. The CLT works better when the sample size is larger.
- [ ] D. It is not closer. The difference is within rounding error.

## Section 4 Overview

Section 4 introduces you to the Big Short.

After completing Section 4, you will:
- understand the relationship between sampling models and interest rates as determined by banks.
- understand how interest rates can be set to minimize the chances of the bank losing money.
- understand how inappropriate assumptions of independence contributed to the financial meltdown of 2007.

The textbook for this section is available [here](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/random-variables.html#case-study-the-big-short)

## Interest Rates Explained

Suppose your bank will give out 1,000 loans for 180,000 this year. Also suppose that your bank loses, after adding up all the costs, $200,000 per foreclosure.For simplicity, we assume that that includes all operational costs. A sampling model for this scenario is coded like this.
```
#Code: Interest rate sampling model
n <- 1000
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000
p <- 0.02
defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE)
sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)
```
```
## [1] -5e+06
```
We either default and lose money, or not default and not lose money. If we run the simulation we see that we lose $2.8 millions. Note that the total loss defined by the final sum is a random variable. Every time you run the code you get a different answer. This is because it’s a probability of defaulting. It’s not going to happen for sure. We can easily construct a Monte Carlo simulation to get an idea of the distribution of this random variable. Here’s the distribution.
```
#Code: Interest rate Monte Carlo simulation
B <- 10000
losses <- replicate(B, {
    defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE) 
  sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)
})
```
```
#Code: Plotting expected losses
library(tidyverse)
```
```
data.frame(losses_in_millions = losses/10^6) %>%
  ggplot(aes(losses_in_millions)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.6, col = "black")
```

![Unknown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17474099/77342879-26ccc300-6d31-11ea-849a-5aac6e6f407d.png)

We don’t really need a Monte Carlo simulation though. Using what we’ve learned, the CLT tells us that because our losses are a sum of independent draws, its distribution is approximately normal with expected value and standard deviation given by the following formula.
```
#Expected value and standard error of the sum of 1,000 loans
n*(p*loss_per_foreclosure + (1-p)*0) # expected value   
```
```
## [1] -4e+06
```
```
sqrt(n)*abs(loss_per_foreclosure)*sqrt(p*(1-p)) # standard error 
```
```
## [1] 885437.7
```
```
#Code: Calculating interest rate for 1% probability of losing money

l <- loss_per_foreclosure
z <- qnorm(0.01)
x <- -l*( n*p - z*sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))/ ( n*(1-p) + z*sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))
x    # required profit when loan is not a foreclosure
```
```
## [1] 6249.181
```
```
x/180000    # interest rate
```
```
## [1] 0.03471767
```
```
loss_per_foreclosure*p + x*(1-p)    # expected value of the profit per loan
```
```
## [1] 2124.198
```
```
n*(loss_per_foreclosure*p + x*(1-p)) # expected value of the profit over n loans
```
```
## [1] 2124198
```
We get that the x has to be about 6,249, which is an interest rate of about 3%, which is still pretty good. Note also that by choosing this interest rate, we now have an expected profit per loan of about $2,124, which is a total expected profit of about $2 million. We can run a Monte Carlo simulation and check our theoretical approximation. We do that, and we indeed get that value again. And again, the probability of profit being less than zero according to the Monte Carlo simulation is about 1%.
```
#Code: Monte Carlo simulation for 1% probability of losing money

B <- 100000
profit <- replicate(B, {
    draws <- sample( c(x, loss_per_foreclosure), n, 
                        prob=c(1-p, p), replace = TRUE) 
    sum(draws)
})
mean(profit)    # expected value of the profit over n loans
```
```
## [1] 2122535
```
```
mean(profit<0)    # probability of losing money
```
```
## [1] 0.01237
```
## The Big Short

One of our employees points out that since the bank is making about $2,000 per loan, that you should give out more loans. Why just n? You explain that finding those n clients was hard. You need a group that is predictable, and that keeps the chances of defaults low. He then points out that even if the probability of default is higher, as long as your expected value is positive, you can minimize your chances of losing money by increasing n, the number of loans, and relying on the law of large numbers. He claims that even if the default rate is twice as high, say 4%, if we set the rate just a bit higher so that this happens, you will get a positive expected value. So if we set the interest rate at 5%, we are guaranteed a positive expected value of $640 per loan. And we can minimize our chances of losing money by simply increasing the number of loans, since the probability of S being less than 0 is equal to the probability of Z being less than negative expected value of S divided by standard error S, with Z a standard normal random variable, as we saw earlier. And if we do the math, we will see that we can pick an n so that this probability is 1 in 100.

## Assessment 7: The Big Short

1. Bank earnings

Say you manage a bank that gives out 10,000 loans. The default rate is 0.03 and you lose $200,000 in each foreclosure.

Create a random variable S that contains the earnings of your bank. Calculate the total amount of money lost in this scenario.
- Using the sample function, generate a vector called defaults that contains n samples from a vector of c(0,1), where 0 indicates a payment and 1 indicates a default
- Multiply the total number of defaults by the loss per foreclosure.
```
# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# Generate a vector called `defaults` that contains the default outcomes of `n` loans
defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, replace = TRUE, prob=c(1-p_default, p_default))

# Generate `S`, the total amount of money lost across all foreclosures. Print the value to the console.
S <- sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)

Run a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 outcomes for S, the sum of losses over 10,000 loans. Make a histogram of the results.
- Within a replicate loop with 10,000 iterations, use sample to generate a list of 10,000 loan outcomes: payment (0) or default (1). Use the outcome order c(0,1) and probability of default p_default.
- Still within the loop, use the function sum to count the number of foreclosures multiplied by loss_per_foreclosure to return the sum of all losses across the 10,000 loans. If you do not take the sum inside the replicate loop, DataCamp may crash with a “Session Expired” error.
- Plot the histogram of values using the function hist.

```
# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1)

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run
B <- 10000

# Generate a list of summed losses 'S'. Replicate the code from the previous exercise over 'B' iterations to generate a list of summed losses for 'n' loans.  Ignore any warnings for now.
S <- replicate(B, {
    defaults <- sample( c(0,1), n, prob=c(1-p_default, p_default), replace = TRUE) 
  sum(defaults * loss_per_foreclosure)
})

# Plot a histogram of 'S'.  Ignore any warnings for now.
hist(S)
```

3. Bank earnings expected value

What is the expected value of S, the sum of losses over 10,000 loans? For now, assume a bank makes no money if the loan is paid.
- Using the chances of default (p_default), calculate the expected losses over 10,000 loans.
```
# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Calculate the expected loss due to default out of 10,000 loans
n*(p_default*loss_per_foreclosure + (1-p_default)*0)
```
```
## [1] -6e+07
```
4. Bank earnings standard error

What is the standard error of S?
- Compute the standard error of the random variable S you generated in the previous exercise, the summed outcomes of 10,000 loans.
```
# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Compute the standard error of the sum of 10,000 loans
sqrt(n) * abs(loss_per_foreclosure) * sqrt(p_default*(1 - p_default))
```
```
## [1] 3411744
```
5. Bank earnings interest rate - 1

So far, we’ve been assuming that we make no money when people pay their loans and we lose a lot of money when people default on their loans. Assume we give out loans for $180,000. How much money do we need to make when people pay their loans so that our net loss is $0?

In other words, what interest rate do we need to charge in order to not lose money?
- If the amount of money lost or gained equals 0, the probability of default times the total loss per default equals the amount earned per probability of the loan being paid.
- Divide the total amount needed per loan by the loan amount to determine the interest rate.
```
# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Assign a variable `x` as the total amount necessary to have an expected outcome of $0
x <- -(loss_per_foreclosure*p_default) / (1 - p_default)

# Convert `x` to a rate, given that the loan amount is $180,000. Print this value to the console.
x / 180000
```
```
## [1] 0.03436426
```
6. Bank earnings interest rate - 2

With the interest rate calculated in the last example, we still lose money 50% of the time. What should the interest rate be so that the chance of losing money is 1 in 20?

In math notation, what should the interest rate be so that Pr(S<0)=0.05?

Remember that we can add a constant to both sides of the equation to get:

- Use the qnorm function to compute a continuous variable at given quantile of the distribution to solve for z.
- In this equation, l, p, and n are known values. Once you’ve solved for z, solve for x.
- Divide x by the loan amount to calculate the rate.
```
# Assign the number of loans to the variable `n`
n <- 10000

# Assign the loss per foreclosure to the variable `loss_per_foreclosure`
loss_per_foreclosure <- -200000

# Assign the probability of default to the variable `p_default`
p_default <- 0.03

# Generate a variable `z` using the `qnorm` function
z <- qnorm(0.05)

# Generate a variable `x` using `z`, `p_default`, `loss_per_foreclosure`, and `n`
x <- -loss_per_foreclosure*( n*p_default - z*sqrt(n*p_default*(1 - p_default)))/ ( n*(1 - p_default) + z*sqrt(n*p_default*(1 - p_default)))

# Convert `x` to an interest rate, given that the loan amount is $180,000. Print this value to the console.
x / 180000
```
```
## [1] 0.03768738
```
7. Bank earnings - minimize money loss

- [ ] B. A larger probability of default
- [X] C. A reduced default rate
- [ ] D. A larger cost per loan default
